# Decision Process

GUI libraries are notoriously complex to design and are prone to easy disapproval.

The DlangGraphicsWG initiative comes from a shared understanding disagreement must be
reified and talked upon, rather than hidden behind individual initiatives.


1. The output of this Work Group is every Markdown .md files in the Organization's repositeries.
   The wiki is only informal.

2. Members of the Github organization DlangGraphicsWG have no special right, 
   apart from being able to merge/reject PRs according to this document.

3. Modifications proposals are brought in through Pull Requests.

4. Voting is open to anyone, as long as the PR is currently open, for a period of at least 24h.
   After this time, a member of the Github Organization is allowed to merge or reject the PR as long as the PR is still open by its author
   
   For being merged a proposal:
      * must have a strict majority of votes
      * must have gathered at least three vote "yes"

   As such, each open PR is a vote to be held.

5. This document is self-referential. Process modifications themselves must follow this document.
