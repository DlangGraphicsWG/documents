# Decision Process

GUI libraries are notoriously complex to design and are prone to easy disapproval.

The DlangGraphicsWG initiative comes from a shared understanding disagreement must be
reified and talked upon, rather than hidden behind individual initiatives.


1. The Output of this Work Group is every Markdown .md files in the Organization's repositories.
   The wiki is only informal.

2. Members of the Github organization DlangGraphicsWG have no special rights, 
   apart from being able to merge/reject Pull Requests according to this document.

3. Modifications proposals to the Output (.md files) are brought in through Pull Requests.

4. Each open Pull Request is a vote to be held. 

   Voting is open to anyone, as long as the PR is currently open, for a period of at least 24h.
   After this time, a member of the Github Organization is allowed to merge or reject the Pull Request.
   
   For being merged, a proposal:
      * must have a strict majority of votes "yes"
      * AND must have gathered at least three vote "yes"
      * must still be open by its author

   For being rejected, a proposal:
      * must have a strict majority of votes "no"
      * AND must have gathered at least three vote "no"

   If there are insufficient votes, or if no one wants to merge/reject yet, the period 
   of voting is extended for 24h, with a maximum of one month. 
   After that duration, it is rejected due to lack of interest.

5. One can vote "yes-if(X)" or "no-if(X)" to a proposal which mean the vote counts as a "yes" 
   if the Proposal's submitter answers the concern of the voter, and a "no" instead.
   This is meant for clarification. Reviewers are trusted to compute X in an impartial way.
   The yes-if and no-if variants of votes have to be managed through Github reviews.
   In the case of a single voter having several Github reviews, whose result is conflicting, 
   the "no" wins.

6. A proposal cannot be merged or rejected by the same person making the proposal.

7. A proposal being merged or rejected doesn't mean the debate is closed.

8. This document is self-referential. Process modifications themselves must follow this document.
